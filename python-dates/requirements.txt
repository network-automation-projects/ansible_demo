# Python Dates Exercise - Dependencies
# ====================================
#
# Core dependencies for the datetime exercises.
# Most exercises use Python 3.9+ standard library (zoneinfo).

# Timezone support (Python 3.9+ has zoneinfo in stdlib)
# For Python < 3.9, uncomment the line below:
# backports.zoneinfo>=0.2.1

# Locale-aware formatting (optional but recommended)
babel>=2.12.0

# Alternative timezone library (if you prefer over zoneinfo)
# pytz>=2023.3  # Not needed if using zoneinfo, but included for reference

# Human-readable relative time (optional, for advanced exercises)
# humanize>=4.7.0  # Uncomment if you want to use humanize library

# Date parsing utilities (optional)
# dateutil>=2.8.2  # Uncomment if you need advanced parsing
