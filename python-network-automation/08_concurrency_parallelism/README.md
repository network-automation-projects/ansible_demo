# Module 08: Concurrency & Parallelism

Parallel operations for efficient network automation.

## Learning Objectives

- Threading for I/O-bound tasks
- Async/await for concurrent operations
- Multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- Thread pools and process pools

## Prerequisites

- Module 01: Core Fundamentals
- Module 04: Device Management

## Concepts Covered

- `threading.Thread/Lock/Event` - Threading primitives
- `multiprocessing.Process/Queue/Pool` - Process management
- `asyncio.run/create_task/gather/sleep` - Async operations
- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor/ProcessPoolExecutor/as_completed` - Executors

## Use Cases

- Parallel device polling
- Concurrent config deployment
- Async data fetching
- Batch operations
