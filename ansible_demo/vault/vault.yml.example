# This file demonstrates the structure for encrypted credentials
# 
# To create an encrypted vault file, run:
#   ansible-vault create vault/vault.yml
#
# To edit an encrypted vault file, run:
#   ansible-vault edit vault/vault.yml
#
# To view an encrypted vault file, run:
#   ansible-vault view vault/vault.yml
#
# To encrypt an existing file, run:
#   ansible-vault encrypt vault/vault.yml
#
# To decrypt a vault file, run:
#   ansible-vault decrypt vault/vault.yml

# Device credentials
vault_username: your_username_here
vault_password: your_password_here
vault_enable_password: your_enable_password_here

# SNMP credentials
vault_snmp_ro_community: your_readonly_community_here
vault_snmp_rw_community: your_readwrite_community_here

# API keys (if needed)
vault_api_key: your_api_key_here

# Other sensitive data
vault_secret_key: your_secret_key_here

# Usage in playbooks:
#   ansible_user: "{{ vault_username }}"
#   ansible_password: "{{ vault_password }}"
#   ansible_become_password: "{{ vault_enable_password }}"
#
# Usage in inventory:
#   ansible_user: "{{ vault_username }}"
#   ansible_password: "{{ vault_password }}"
#
# To use vault variables in playbooks, reference the vault file:
#   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
#   OR
#   ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
